First download the binary for NuSMV and mention it in path variables.

Then in command line:
NuSMV -int
> read_model -i name_of_file.smv
> flatte_hierarchy
> encode_variables
> build_model
> print_reachable_states -v

> picl_state -i
> simulate -i -k no_of_steps

OR: to read, faltten, encode and build; you can use go.
